#+TITLE: Ren'Py mode

A major mode for editing Ren'Py files.

** Installation

Either install the ~renpy-mode~ package from within Emacs directly from MELPA or:

- Download/clone this repo to your desired location.

- In Emacs, use the ~package-install-file~ command and point it to the renpy-mode.el
  file location.

** Features

- Movement, indentation and syntax highlighting for Ren'py and embedded Python.

- Outline Minor Mode support for an overview of block-defining statements.

- In-buffer navigation with Imenu.

- Context-sensitive symbol completion.

- Jumping to symbol definitions with Xref.

- Compiling, running, linting from within Emacs.

- Running renpy CLI subcommands.

- Error highlighting with Flymake.

** Configuration

Example configuration with the ~use-package~ macro:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package renpy-mode
    ;; Install the package unless installed already.
    :ensure t
    ;; Uncomment and tweak if renpy-mode was downloaded into a custom.
    ;; location.
    ;; :load-path "path/to/renpy/dir"
    :custom
    ;; Path to the Ren'Py launcher or renpy.sh / renpy.exe.
    (renpy-program "path/to/renpy")
    :bind
    ;; Bind some useful commands.
    ("C-c C-c" . renpy-compile)
    ("C-c C-r" . renpy-run)
    ("C-c C-l" . renpy-lint)
    :hook
    ;; Enable on-the-fly linting and code overview.
    ((renpy-mode . flymake-mode)
     (renpy-mode . outline-minor-mode))) ; code overview
#+end_src

** Commands and bindings

Once configured, try within a ~renpy-mode~ buffer:

- ~M-x renpy-run~ - launch the project.

- ~M-x renpy-lint~ - run lint with compilation-mode.

- ~M-x renpy-compile~ - run compile with compilation-mode.

- ~C-c <~ - shift lines left.

- ~C-c >~ - shift lines right.

- ~TAB~ - cycle through possible indentation levels.

- ~C-c C-n~ - next statement.

- ~C-c C-p~ - previous statement.

- ~C-c C-u~ - beginning of black.

- ~C-c C-k~ - mark block.

- ~C-c C-j~ show Imenu.

- ~M-.~ jump to label / screen / transform definitions.

** History

The mode is based on Leo Liu's fork of the original Emacs's Python mode
(python.el) by Dave Love.

In its Ren'py incarnation the mode was imported to Github in 2015 by Quil
(@robotlolita), then taken over by Trey Merkley (@treymerkley), followed by
Reagan Middlebrook (@reagankm).  A major refresh of the code was made by Morgan
Willcock (@morganwillcock) in 2023, followed by features added by Vladimir
Kazanov in 2025.

Come at me, parentheses. I dare you.
